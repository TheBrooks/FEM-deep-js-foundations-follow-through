Follow through of the Front End Master course 'Deep JS Foundations' by Kyle Simpson

following this tutorial in efforts to increase my breadth of knowledge using both JavaScript and especially the changes brought about in ES6.  This class has a wider and deeper course than the 'ES6: the right parts'.

My goal is to take this learning forward in my everyday coding and write code that takes advantage of the features provided by ES6 in Javascript. I am also hoping this knowledge will help keep me up to date with the changing technologies and make reading other online tutorials/troubleshooting posts easier.

The plan is to watch one chunk of the tutorial a day to learn a given topic, turning this tutorial into a 10 day managable experience where each day I summaraize all the knowledge I learned on the topic.  Spreading it out over multiple days will re-enforce the what I learned in each section as well as allowing time for the topic to sink in making the knowledge more engrained.
